# MicroWin VirtIO Integration

Automated VirtIO driver integration for MicroWin Windows 11 ISOs. This PowerShell script post-processes MicroWin ISOs to create fully "first-boot-ready" virtual machine images with complete VirtIO support.

**Works with any VirtIO-capable virtualization platform:** Proxmox VE, QEMU, KVM, oVirt, and more.

## üéØ What This Does

This script eliminates all manual driver installation steps by:

- **Injecting all 10 VirtIO drivers** into both `install.wim` (installed system) and `boot.wim` (Windows installer/WinPE)
- **Bundling virtio-win-guest-tools.exe** and configuring automatic silent installation after OOBE
- **Generating bootable ISOs** with UEFI/BIOS dual-boot support
- **Auto-detecting source files** in your working directory
- **Smart ISO naming** with descriptive volume labels (under 32 characters)

### The Problem This Solves

Deploying Windows VMs with VirtIO hardware typically involves a frustrating multi-step process with numerous manual interventions:

#### Problem #1: The Installer Can't See Your Disk
The Windows installer immediately greets you with **"no drives found"** because `boot.wim` (the Windows PE environment) doesn't include VirtIO storage drivers. You're forced to either:
- Load drivers manually during setup (requires mounting the VirtIO ISO, browsing folders, multiple clicks)
- Use IDE/SATA emulation as a workaround, then reconfigure to VirtIO later
- Create a custom answer file to inject drivers (complex and error-prone)

#### Problem #2: Missing Drivers After Installation
Even after getting Windows installed, your work isn't done. Opening Device Manager reveals a sea of yellow warning triangles:
- Network adapter not working (no connectivity)
- Unknown devices for balloon driver, serial ports, RNG device
- Missing drivers for input devices and other VirtIO hardware
- Each driver requires manual installation, system reboots, and verification

#### Problem #3: Guest Tools Installation
To get full VM integration (QEMU Guest Agent for proper shutdown, snapshots, and monitoring), you need to:
- Mount the VirtIO ISO again in the running VM
- Manually run virtio-win-guest-tools.exe
- Wait for installation and reboot
- Verify services are running correctly

#### Problem #4: Repeat for Every VM
Every single Windows VM deployment means repeating this entire process. For organizations deploying multiple VMs, this becomes a significant time sink and potential source of errors.

### This Script's Solution

**This script eliminates ALL of these problems completely.**

Your output ISO:
- ‚úÖ **Boots and installs immediately** with VirtIO storage visible from the start
- ‚úÖ **Has zero missing drivers** - Device Manager is completely clean after first boot
- ‚úÖ **Installs guest tools automatically** - QEMU Guest Agent, SPICE components, and all VirtIO services start automatically after OOBE
- ‚úÖ **Requires zero manual intervention** - True "hands-off" deployment from ISO boot to fully functional VM

The result: **What used to take 30-60 minutes of manual work per VM now takes zero.** Just boot the ISO, let Windows install, and you have a fully functional VirtIO-enabled VM with all drivers and tools pre-configured.

## ‚ú® Features

- ‚úÖ **Complete automation** - Zero manual driver installation required
- ‚úÖ **Boot.wim injection** - Installer can see VirtIO storage immediately (no IDE workaround!)
- ‚úÖ **Install.wim injection** - All drivers available in installed system
- ‚úÖ **Guest tools auto-install** - QEMU Guest Agent and SPICE components install silently after OOBE
- ‚úÖ **Smart file detection** - Automatically finds MicroWin ISO, VirtIO ISO, and guest tools
- ‚úÖ **Proper bootable ISOs** - Full UEFI and BIOS support via oscdimg
- ‚úÖ **Clean volume labels** - Descriptive names under 32 characters (ISO9660 compatible)

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Windows with PowerShell 5.1+ (run as Administrator)
- [MicroWin](https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/winutil) processed Windows 11 ISO
- [VirtIO drivers ISO](https://fedorapeople.org/groups/virt/virtio-win/direct-downloads/stable-virtio/) (e.g., virtio-win-0.1.285.iso)
- [virtio-win-guest-tools.exe](https://fedorapeople.org/groups/virt/virtio-win/direct-downloads/stable-virtio/) (optional but recommended)

### Usage

1. **Place all files in the same directory:**
   ```
   your-folder/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Integrate-VirtIO-MicroWin.ps1
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MicroWin11_25H2_English_x64.iso
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ virtio-win-0.1.285.iso
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ virtio-win-guest-tools.exe (optional)
   ```

2. **Run the script:**
   ```powershell
   .\Integrate-VirtIO-MicroWin.ps1
   ```

3. **Wait for completion** (~15-20 minutes)

4. **Use the output ISO** with your VirtIO-enabled VM!

### Manual File Selection

If you prefer to specify files explicitly:

```powershell
.\Integrate-VirtIO-MicroWin.ps1 `
    -MicroWinISO ".\MicroWin11_25H2_English_x64.iso" `
    -VirtIOISO ".\virtio-win-0.1.285.iso" `
    -GuestToolsExe ".\virtio-win-guest-tools.exe"
```

## üìã VirtIO Drivers Included

The script injects all essential VirtIO drivers for Windows 11:

| Driver | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **NetKVM** | Virtual network adapter |
| **viostor** | VirtIO SCSI block storage |
| **vioscsi** | VirtIO SCSI controller |
| **Balloon** | Dynamic memory management |
| **viorng** | Random number generator |
| **vioserial** | Virtual serial port |
| **qemupciserial** | PCI-based serial |
| **vioinput** | Keyboard and mouse input |
| **pvpanic** | Guest crash notification |
| **viofs** | VirtIO-FS shared filesystem |

## üéì How It Works

1. **Mounts source ISOs** - MicroWin and VirtIO ISOs
2. **Extracts ISO contents** - Copies MicroWin ISO to working directory
3. **Verifies boot files** - Ensures BIOS and UEFI boot files exist
4. **Injects drivers into install.wim** - Adds VirtIO drivers to the installed Windows image
5. **Injects drivers into boot.wim** - Adds VirtIO drivers to Windows installer/WinPE environment
6. **Adds guest tools** - Copies virtio-win-guest-tools.exe and creates SetupComplete.cmd for auto-install
7. **Creates bootable ISO** - Uses oscdimg to generate properly bootable ISO with dual-boot support
8. **Cleans up** - Removes temporary files

## üñ•Ô∏è Tested Platforms

- ‚úÖ Proxmox VE (primary target)
- ‚úÖ QEMU/KVM
